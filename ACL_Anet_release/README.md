# Action Co-localization

## Introduction
This is a pytorch implementation of **Learning Temporal Co-Attention Models for Unsupervised Video Action Localization** on ActivityNet-1.2. Please note that this project is still under construction, and we will modify and optimize part of the code in the future.

## Environment
The code is developed using python 3.5 on Ubuntu 16.04. NVIDIA GPUs are needed.
